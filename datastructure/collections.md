# Data Structure - Collections

## ArrayList vs. LinkedList vs. Vector (JAVA)

### ArrayList

- `ArrayList` is implemented as a resizable **array**
- `ArrayList` grow **50%** of its size each time

### LinkedList

- `LinkedList` is implemented as a **double linked list**
- performance on `add` and `remove` is better than `Arraylist`
- worse on `get` and `set` methods

### Vector

- `Vector` is similar with `ArrayList`, but it is `synchronized`
